# Figr AI Code Assistant (Mistral:7B)
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f250160c-0fa8-47e7-a431-cdb993f93913
## Project Overview
An advanced AI Code Assistant designed to showcase creative coding approaches and efficient implementation of AI-based code analysis, developed as part of an assignment to build a simple coding assistant.

### Objective
To demonstrate the ability to:
1. Understand Python programming requests/questions from a user.
2. Generate Python code solutions or function templates.
3. Test the generated code through execution or simulation.
4. Request additional user input when necessary.

This project highlights practical applications of LLMs for code generation, analysis, and testing while adhering to clear design principles and assumptions.

## Key Features üåü

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Code Analysis**: Contextually processes Python code queries.
- **Real-time Code Generation**: Produces Python code solutions and function templates.
- **Code Testing**: Executes or simulates tests for generated code snippets.
- **Interactive Input Handling**: Requests additional details when needed for clarity.
- **File Upload Analysis**: Evaluates uploaded `.py` files for errors and potential improvements.
- **Persistent Chat History**: Stores conversation context using SQLite for session continuity.

### Creativity in Design
This assistant integrates:
- Mocked or stubbed function calls where full implementations are complex.
- Straightforward logic to simulate sophisticated workflows when appropriate.
- Retry mechanisms for failed responses with user-friendly feedback.

## Technical Implementation üíª

### Frontend
- HTML5 with Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- Syntax-highlighted code rendering via Highlight.js.
- Markdown processing using Marked.js.
- Real-time code copying and testing capabilities.
- File upload handling with immediate analysis feedback.

### Backend
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for API integration.
- **SQLite**: Contextual memory management for chat persistence.
- **LLM Integration**: Leveraging Mistral-7B with LangChain for structured responses and dual-prompt code analysis.

### Memory Management

## Technical Architecture üèóÔ∏è
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Main Flask application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/            
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # Frontend interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chat_database.db      # SQLite database
```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/chat`: Main conversation endpoint.
- `/api/test-code`: Code execution endpoint.
- `/api/chat-list`: Chat history management.
- `/api/chat-history`: Session history retrieval.
- `/api/clear-memory`: Memory management.

### Database Schema
```sql
- chats (id, title, date, last_message)
- messages (id, chat_id, role, content, timestamp)
- important_info (id, chat_id, content)
```
