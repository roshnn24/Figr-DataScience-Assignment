## Technical Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Core Components
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Main Flask application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/            
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # Frontend interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chat_database.db      # SQLite database
```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/chat`: Main conversation endpoint
- `/api/test-code`: Code execution endpoint
- `/api/chat-list`: Chat history management
- `/api/chat-history`: Session history retrieval
- `/api/clear-memory`: Memory management

### Database Schema
```sql
- chats (id, title, date, last_message)
- messages (id, chat_id, role, content, timestamp)
- important_info (id, chat_id, content)
```

## Bonus Features Implemented ‚≠ê
1. **Efficient Memory Management**
   - Automatic cleanup of old conversations
   - Smart content persistence strategy
   
2. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Built-in retry button for failed responses
   - Error handling with user feedback

## Usage Example
```python
User: "Find the user with highest transaction amount from CSV"
Assistant: "Here's the solution:
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_highest_transaction():
    df = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')
    totals = df.groupby('user_id')['amount'].sum()
    return totals.idxmax(), totals.max()
```
Testing with sample data...
Result: user202 has highest total: $450.5"
```

## Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install Pandoc for markdown rendering
4. Run: `python app.py`
5. Access: `http://localhost:5000`

## Future Improvements üîÑ
- Optimizing conversation buffer management
- Enhancing code snippet rendering reliability
- Implementing batch file analysis
- Adding support for multiple programming languages
- Introducing collaborative coding features

## Technologies Used üîß
- Python/Flask
- SQLite
